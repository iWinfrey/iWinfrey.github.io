                <p>This is a web portfolio that I designed using HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of JavaScript.
                    It is not completed and this is only the start of it.
                    I will be adding more content to the site as I figure out 
                    new ideas.</p>
        <p>Anyways I still have ways to go but now that I have tech and software
            I am pretty sure this will go well</p>
        <p>This will be the main page in which users who visit the site will
            be able to view the content by going through the nav links towards the top of the page</p>
