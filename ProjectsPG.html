          This is my rock, paper, scissors game that I coded in JavaScript. I
          made this in high school and found the file for it and decided to make
          it work this time and adjust it. For the most part it works fine. I'm
          still adding little extra stuff to it to make it more entertaining and
          appealing. It may have some issues when it comes to how many rounds it
          does. I'm still working on figuring out the bugs for it but for the
          most part it works decently.

          Here is a classic pong game that I used JavaScript as the code. I had
          to watch to tutorial video from Udemy to make it. It's slightly
          different than the way they have it and I might make some other
          additions to the game in some time. Until then, the core gameplay
          works and so does the scoring system, so please enjoy. The game ends
          after one side reaches 3 points. When the game is over, you will be
          prompted to click the screen to restart it, otherwise just hit the
          back button or go to another page to leave. Use the mouse to control
          the left side paddle.

          Here is one of my projects that I've worked in my Intro to Software
          Engineering class. This project was worked on in a group of 4 people
          that were in my class. I worked on this app with my other group
          members: Aaron Hammer, Trevor Konya, and Madison Yancey. We were given
          a python API that was capable of processing image data and determine
          if it contains any food or not. It would use confidence intervals as a
          method of measurement to see if the images that are uploaded to the
          server are food and would return the results.
