        <p>Here is where you would find the projects on this page. I still need to search through and find them
        while also making changes to them so that they work properly. There will be more added in the future.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <article><p>This is my rock, paper, scissors game that I coded in JavaScript.
                I made this in high school and found the file for it and decided to make it work
                this time and adjust it.
                For the most part it works fine. I'm still adding little extra stuff to it
                to make it more entertaining and appealing. It may have some issues 
                when it comes to how many rounds it does. I'm still working on 
                figuring out the bugs for it but for the most part it works decently.</p>

            <p>Here is a classic pong game that I used JavaScript as the code. I 
                had to watch to tutorial video from Udemy to make it. It's slightly different
                than the way they have it and I might make some other additions to the game in some time. Until then, the core gameplay
                works and so does the scoring system, so please enjoy. The game ends after one side reaches 3 points.
                When the game is over, you will be prompted to click the screen to restart it, otherwise just hit the back button or 
                go to another page to leave. Use the mouse to control the left side paddle.

        <h2>Java/Kotlin</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Here is one of my projects that I've worked in my Intro to Software Engineering class. This project
            was worked on in a group of 4 people that were in my class. I worked on this app with my other group members: Aaron Hammer, Trevor Konya, and 
            Madison Yancey. We were given a python API that was capable of 
            processing image data and determine if it contains any food or not. It would use confidence intervals as a method
            of measurement to see if the images that are uploaded to the server are food and would return the results. </p>
