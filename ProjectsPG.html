        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <article><p>This is my rock, paper, scissors game that I coded in JavaScript.
                I made this in high school and found the file for it and decided to make it work
                this time and adjust it.
                For the most part it works fine. I'm still adding little extra stuff to it
                to make it more entertaining and appealing. It may have some issues 
                when it comes to how many rounds it does. I'm still working on 
                figuring out the bugs for it but for the most part it works decently.</p>
