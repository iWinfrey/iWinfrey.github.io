                <p>This will be an about me page.</p>
                <p>Of course this page will contain information about yours truly
                    but currently there is not much at the moment to be said until
                    I can get everything else going for other pages too. Hang tight!</p>
                <p>My name is Isaiah Winfrey. I am currently a junior/senior attending Wright State University
                    and plan to graduate fall 2019. I am aiming to get a Bachelors in the major
                    of Computer Science. </p>
                <p>My career goal is to go into the field of IT as a software
                    developer and work with application development. In my spare time I also attempt 
                    work with making my own games and applications. I have been doing 
                    studying outside of classes to learn more with coding and developing. 
                    At the moment I don't have much but I am currently working with the basics
                    for game making and will hopefully have something to display in due time.</p>

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <article>
            <p>To go along with being a computer science major, I also have some skills 
                and experience in coding. I have started coding since my junior year in high school.
                Some of them I did not have too much experience with as far as class assignments.
                Ever since then when I started college and learning other languages I decided to 
                look more into different languages and relearn the ones I used in high school.
