        <p>This will be an about me page.</p>
        <p>Of course this page will contain information about yours truly
            but currently there is not much at the moment to be said until
            I can get everything else going for other pages too. Hang tight!</p>

           and attempting to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
