        My name is Isaiah Winfrey. I am a graduate of Wright State University
        with Bachelor of Arts Degree in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career goal as of right now is to work on my computer and technical
        skills. I am looking to develop new skills and discover where my skills
        are best at. In my spare time I also attempt work with making my own
        projects such as applications and games. I have been doing studying
        outside of classes to learn more with coding and developing. At the
        moment I don't have much but I am currently working with the basics for
        game making and will hopefully have something to display in due time.

        <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>
        To go along with being a graduate in computer science, I also have some
        skills and experience in coding. I have started coding since my junior
        year in high school. Some of them I did not have too much experience
        with as far as class assignments. Ever since then when I started college
        and learning other languages I decided to look more into different
        languages and relearn the ones I used in high school.
